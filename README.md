## Hello there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="30" height="30" />

I am Siddharth, an ex-PSU banker turned data analyst. I am fascinated by the world of data and want to leverage it to make the world a better place. I work with SQL, Python, Excel and PowerBI on a daily basis. 

I am currently pursuing a certification course on AI and ML by Analytics Vidhya. I also hold a degree in Social Entrepreneurship. 

I enjoy learning new things and solving complex problems. 

I am fairly new to GitHub and still learning the ropes. I hope one day this page can act as an inspiration/resource to all the aspiring data analysts/scientists out there. 

Feel free to reach out to me for any prospective project, opportunities or just a plain chat.
